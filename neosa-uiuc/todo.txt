This file will contain all things that must be done

If you are working on something on the list, add your name after it, then push it to github right away, so we don't have everyone doing the same task.
With that said, make sure to constantly PULL your code, so you know who is working on what!

For now most of the following should be completed by Tuesday lecture:

about.html will needs styling
someone should read up on how to sync someone else's Google Calendar
the map needs a bit of logic, I need someone to make it display your current location, and updates in real time.
Someone needs to create and contact page, the html file plus styling


if you think I am missing anything, simply add a new task to this file.
Once again make sure you are pulling constantly to ensure the most up to date file.
